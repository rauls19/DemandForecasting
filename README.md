# A Comparative Study on Fashion Demand Forecasting Models with Multiple Sources of Uncertainty
Machine learning techniques allow predicting customer demand to optimize supply decisions. Our goal is to make a comparative study of Demand forecasting models, as for example, regression models (multivariate linear regression, k-nearest neighbour regression, XBoost, Gaussian process regression), neural networks and ensembles  for forecasting, to determine those that best suit for the task of forecasting when applied to a real dataset from online retail company Camper.
Feature importance and causality analysis for assessing which input variables are the most influence in sales must be considered. Additional exogenous variables as general fashion trends which can be extracted from social networks like Twitter or Google trends analytics that can have an impact on sales, although they are not from the commerce itself, can be considered. Moreover, an interpretability layer has to be added to the final model in order to allow the user (commercial director) understand the decisions of the model.
